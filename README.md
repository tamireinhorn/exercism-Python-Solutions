# Exercism
 
 These are all of my current exercises on the Python track I'm taking on Exercism. All exercises here are finished and functioning and the idea is to use this repo to keep track of my progress on my journey learning. I expect this repo to be uploaded almost daily with new exercises, as well as updates for the old exercises refactoring my code every once in a while. 
 Since just the Exercism website validates the exercises as done, the idea is that this repo should only contain commits for SOLVED exercises, to keep it clean. Should I be stuck in an exercise locally, I will simply branch it separately and only merge it with Main when it's done.
